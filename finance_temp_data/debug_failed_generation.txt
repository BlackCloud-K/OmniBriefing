## Step 1: Get Prices
First, we need to fetch and store the prices for all the tickers from the provided watchlists. The watchlists are:
- Market Indices: ^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC
- Tech Watchlist: NVDA, TSLA, AMD, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL
- Industrial Watchlist: BA, XOM, F
- Commodities Watchlist: GC=F, CL=F, NG=F

We will call `fetch_and_store_prices` with all these tickers.

## Step 2: Select Stocks by Volatility
After fetching prices, we will review the price changes and select 5-8 stocks with the highest volatility (i.e., |change_percent| > 1%).

## Step 3: Get News for Selected Stocks
For the selected stocks from Step 2, we will call `search_news_options` with a limit of 3 news articles per stock. We will then review the news menu, select news indices based on keywords like Earnings, Guidance, Acquisition, Layoffs, CEO, FDA, Lawsuit, and call `summarize_selected_indices` to get a financial news summary.

## Step 4: Quality Control
We will review the summaries and remove any low-quality or duplicate news using `remove_news_summaries`. It is critical that each stock from Step 2 keeps at least one news summary.

## Step 5: Generate Report
Finally, we will call `export_final_report` to generate a final Markdown-formatted market report.

Let's start with Step 1: Get Prices.

## Step 1: Get Prices
The combined list of tickers from all watchlists is:
[^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC, NVDA, TSLA, AMD, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, BA, XOM, F, GC=F, CL=F, NG=F]
